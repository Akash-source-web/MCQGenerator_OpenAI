# MCQ Generator OpenAI
### Overview
MCQGenerator is a tool designed to automatically generate multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from text-based content using LangChain and OpenAI's GPT models. This project leverages advanced natural language processing techniques to create high-quality MCQs for educational purposes, quizzes, or assessments.

### Features
* **Automated Question Generation:** Generate multiple-choice questions from any text input, including articles, documents, or user-provided content.
* **Customizable Difficulty Levels:** Adjust the complexity of the questions to suit different knowledge levels.
* **Answer Validation:** Ensure that generated questions have clear, unambiguous correct answers and plausible distractors (incorrect options).
* **Integration with LangChain:** Utilize the power of LangChain to streamline the process of text analysis and question generation.
* **OpenAI GPT-3 Powered:** Harness the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT models for natural language understanding and generation.

### Installation
1. Clone the Repository:
                                            
        git clone https://github.com/Akash-source-web/MCQGenerator_OpenAI.git

        cd MCQGenerator_OpenAI

2. Install Dependencies:
        
        pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set Up OpenAI API:
    * Sign up for an API key at OpenAI.
    * Set up the environment variable:

            export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
### How It Works
* **Text Analysis:** The input text is processed using LangChain to extract key concepts and relevant information.
* **Question Formation:** OpenAI's GPT models are utilized to craft questions, generate answer options, and select the correct answer.
* **Output:** A structured set of MCQs is produced, ready for use in quizzes, tests, or educational material.
